# FoxPonsonFinal
Final Design For Fox Website

My website was designed to show off a few of my works under my
creative alias "Fox Ponson" and to impressive upon visitors my 
eye for aesthetic and care for art

I chose shades of blue and purple as a signifier of my personal color theming
It's a satisfying range of color which envokes a sense of calm and magic imo

I chose Cardo simply due to it's formal, classy aesthetic. I found that it pairs
quite nicely with my FoxPonson logo's typeface ChelseaAlternates which, while
also formal, has a blend of whimsy to it due the incorporation of curly strokes
in some of its letterings

The layout was formed with optimization in mind, to appear pleasant on desktop
while having a vertical stack layout that can easily accomodate smaller device screens
like tablets and phones. General paragraph & section spacing were decided by
guage of eye, something easy to look at. I made sure to keep paragraph text tidy by
justifying, making the last line center, and setting a max width to keep everything boxed

I found that words in my paragraph text would have random spacing depending on how
many words were included the separated bodies. I accomodated this mostly by going 
back and rewriting the sentences so as to update the spacing and get it tolerable

I had an issue with my header logo not fitting on a smaller viewport like for phones, so
I scaled down the image and made sure to apply display flex to it so it can scale with
viewport changes

My fox icon would spin around my star and clip the edge, so I had to change the Y translation
to accomodate the clipping

I found that the Contact nav link was somewhat unecessary due to the Music Production section
being so close to the Contact section at the bottom of the page. It's not an ideal fix to remove the 
Contact nav, but for now I find it odd

The nav links in general would snap you to places on the page too close together as is, so I made sure
to ellaborate more in my About Me and remove the Aspirations/Hobbies nav link given that it was visably 
right below the About Me section

I had to optimize down the website size due to originally including far more examples of my photos
and music. Since I'm hosting on Github Live Pages, there's a cap of 20 megabytes

My background overlay would fade too quickly, so it'd be really hard to tell that the image that appears
is a graphic of stars, so I added another opacity interval, same as the original peak, to drag it out. Also
extended the duration
